      Quatuor Mémoire is a Montréal-based string quartet dedicated to
      contemporary music. Formed in 2024, the ensemble includes Bailey Wantuch
      and Meggie Lacombe (violins), Marilou Lepage (viola), and Audréanne Filion
      (cello), graduates of the Conservatoire de musique de Montréal and the
      Schulich School of Music at McGill University. Their name reflects their
      mission: to contribute to the formation of collective memory through the
      creation and dissemination of today’s repertoire.

    <div class="text-left text-lg flex items-center justify-center">
      Since its founding, Mémoire has launched numerous creative projects,
      including appearances at the 8th and 9th editions of Vivier
      InterUniversitaire and a concert produced by Collectif Radiance featuring
      new works by Florence Tremblay, Louis-Michel Tougas, and Olivier
      St-Pierre. These works appear on the quartet’s debut album, Chronos,
      Kaïros et Aiôn, scheduled for release on the label Mnémosyne in November
      2025. Mémoire also participated in the “4:4 Project,” a co-production
      between Montréal Nouvelles Musiques 2025 and INIS (Institut national de
      l'image et du son).

      In addition to new music, Mémoire has explored Canadian works from the
      20th century, including quartets by Jean Coulthard, Serge Garant, and John
      Weinzweig. Notably, they gave the first full performance of Serge Garant’s
      Trois pièces pour quatuor à cordes (1958).

      Highlights of the 2025-2026 season include a co-production with No Hay
      Banda to present two new works for quartet and soprano by Lily Koslow and
      Hannah A. Barnes, and the premiere of Olivier St-Pierre’s concerto for
      string quartet alongside Ensemble Éclat as part of the SMCQ’s
      60th-anniversary season. The quartet will also give workshops for student
      composers at McGill University and participate in a series of workshops
      around contemporary music creation in partnership with the Chapelle
      historique du Bon-Pasteur and composer Francis Battah.
